The bot was built using jQuery and setInterval, with the bot running indefinitely. The process begins by navigating to the Facebook search page and searching for the desired friend name with location. The jQuery library is then included in the Chrome console panel, which can be opened using the F12 key or by right-clicking and selecting the Inspect option. The jQuery library is included due to its ease of use for DOM access.
The bot works by first checking for any Confirm or Exception popups every two seconds, and automatically clicking the Confirm button and removing the Exception layer if it exists. This is done using the setInterval function and jQuery to select and interact with the relevant elements.
A variable called 'friendsArr' is declared, which will later store references to DOM elements, and the 'addFriends' function is called once. The 'addFriends' function sets 'friendsArr' to contain references to elements with the class 'FriendRequestAdd', with a counter set to 0. A timer is then set to trigger the click event of the add friend button one by one every four seconds.
When all visible friends are processed, the bot removes the old friends blocks, scrolls to the bottom to load new friends, and then restarts the process. It does this by manipulating the scrollTop property of the scrolling element, which is either the document's scrollingElement or the document body if the former is not defined.
The setInterval function is then cleared, and the 'addFriends' function is called again to restart the proces.
The bot also integrates with DialogFlow and Chatfuel, with a function for sending responses, creating text messages, handling responses, and handling errors. The endpoint function parses the request URL, initiates a text request with the session ID and contexts, and sets up response and error handlers for the request.
