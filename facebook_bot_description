# Facebook Bot JS Script

This repository contains a JavaScript script that automates certain actions on Facebook using the Chrome console panel. The bot was built using jQuery and setInterval, and it runs indefinitely.

## Overview

The script performs the following actions:

1. Navigates to the Facebook search page and searches for the desired friend name with location.
2. Includes the jQuery library in the Chrome console panel for easy DOM access.
3. Checks for Confirm or Exception popups every two seconds and automatically clicks the Confirm button and removes the Exception layer if they exist.
4. Stores references to DOM elements in a variable called 'friendsArr'.
5. Triggers the click event of the add friend button one by one every four seconds.
6. Removes old friend blocks, scrolls to the bottom to load new friends, and restarts the process.
7. Integrates with DialogFlow and Chatfuel for handling responses and errors.

## Usage

1. Open Facebook and navigate to the search page.
2. Open the Chrome console panel by pressing the F12 key or right-clicking and selecting Inspect.
3. Copy and paste the code from the script.js file into the console.
4. The bot will start running automatically.

Note: Make sure you have the jQuery library included in the page before running the script.

## Disclaimer

Please use this script responsibly and in accordance with Facebook's terms of service. Automating actions on Facebook may violate their policies, so use it at your own risk.

## Integration with DialogFlow and Chatfuel

The script also integrates with DialogFlow and Chatfuel for handling responses. It includes functions for sending responses, creating text messages, and handling errors. The endpoint function parses the request URL, initiates a text request with the session ID and contexts, and sets up response and error handlers for the request.
