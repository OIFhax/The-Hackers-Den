## The Problem

The error occurred because the `pipe` method was trying to create a `User` object by unpacking the entire `__user__` dictionary, which contained a 'valves' key that isn't defined in the `User` class.

## The Solution

I modified the code to filter the `__user__` dictionary before creating the `User` object, ensuring only the expected parameters are passed:

```python
# Filter __user__ dictionary to only include keys expected by User class
user_data = {k: v for k, v in __user__.items() if k in ['id', 'email', 'name', 'role']}
self.__user__ = User(**user_data)
```

This change ensures that only the fields defined in the `User` dataclass ('id', 'email', 'name', and 'role') are passed to the constructor, preventing the "unexpected keyword argument" error.
